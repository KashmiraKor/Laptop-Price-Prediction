# Laptop-Price-Prediction

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about laptops, including features like CPU brand, RAM, GPU, operating system, and price. The analysis begins with data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and content, followed by visualization techniques to uncover patterns and relationships between variables. Feature engineering is employed to prepare the data for model building, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features. 

Machine learning models are trained to predict laptop prices based on the available features. The models' performance is evaluated using metrics like R2 score and mean absolute error, providing insights into their predictive accuracy. Ultimately, the project aims to develop a robust model for predicting laptop prices, demonstrating best practices in data analysis and machine learning.
